# Dynamic Writing System

## Overview
The Dynamic Writing System is an AI-augmented writing tool that implements the "Teach the LLM what good looks like" methodology. It combines structured content organization, intelligent prompt engineering, and personalized editing to create high-quality written content.

## Core Concept
This system enhances LLM interactions by providing clear context through four key components:
- Content structuring
- Style guidance
- Template frameworks
- Audience understanding

The system then applies personalized editing patterns to refine outputs.

## System Architecture

### 1. Content Management System
Stores and manages writing assets:
- Style guides derived from example content
- Document templates and structures
- Audience profiles and preferences
- Editing patterns and preferences

### 2. Input Processing Pipeline
Transforms raw input into structured prompts:
```
Raw Input → Initial Structure → Component Integration → Master Prompt
```

Key features:
- Natural language processing for content structure
- Intelligent component selection
- Dynamic prompt assembly

### 3. LLM Integration Layer
Handles interaction with Claude API:
- Authentication and session management
- Request rate limiting and queuing
- Response processing and validation
- Error handling and retry logic

### 4. Editing Agent System
Applies learned editing patterns:
- Pattern recognition from past edits
- Style consistency checking
- Content refinement suggestions
- Continuous learning from new edits

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up basic infrastructure
   - Database for writing assets
   - API integration framework
   - Basic user interface

2. Implement core storage
   - Style guide management
   - Template storage
   - Audience guide organization

3. Create basic prompt processing
   - Input structuring
   - Component integration
   - Basic prompt generation

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
1. Develop editing agent
   - Pattern recognition system
   - Edit history analysis
   - Suggestion generation

2. Enhance prompt engineering
   - Dynamic template selection
   - Context-aware style application
   - Audience adaptation

3. Implement learning system
   - Edit pattern collection
   - Performance tracking
   - Pattern refinement

### Phase 3: Refinement & Integration
1. Add advanced features
   - Batch processing
   - Version control
   - Performance analytics

2. Enhance user experience
   - Interactive editing interface
   - Real-time suggestions
   - Progress tracking

3. Implement feedback loops
   - Quality metrics
   - Usage analytics
   - Pattern effectiveness tracking

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Style Guide
```python
# Example process for creating a style guide
1. Input exemplar content
2. Extract style patterns
3. Validate with test content
4. Refine and store
```

### Processing Raw Input
```python
# Example flow for processing raw content
1. Accept unstructured input
2. Apply structure analysis
3. Match with relevant guides
4. Generate master prompt
5. Apply editing patterns
```

### Training the Editing Agent
```python
# Example training process
1. Collect editing history
2. Extract pattern rules
3. Validate patterns
4. Apply to new content
5. Gather feedback
```
